# Autohotkey-Auto-Clicker-Script-Exe-download-
This is a script where you click f2 to start/stop the autoclicker. There are 2 files, one with .ahk and one with .exe. If you have autohotkey installed (autohotkey download: https://www.autohotkey.com), you can install the .ahk file and use it. But if you don't have autohotkey or if you don't wanna install it, you can install the .exe of this autoclicker.

If you want to change the key(for example f2 to f3 or anyother key) you need to open the .ahk file with notepad. Then change the:
"F2::Pause" to "F1::Pause".  Save the file then right click the red "H" logo in the right bottom corner (if you can't see press the litte arrow) then press "Reload this script" button. Hope it helps!
