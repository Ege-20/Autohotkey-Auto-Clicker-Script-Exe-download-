# Autohotkey-Auto-Clicker-Script-Exe-download-
This is a script where you click f2 to start/stop the autoclicker. There are 2 files, one with .ahk and one with .exe. If you have autohotkey installed, you can install the .ahk file and use it. But if you don't have autohotkey or if you don't wanna install it, you can install the .exe of this autoclicker.
